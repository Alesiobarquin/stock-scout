      "conviction_score": 8,
      "thesis": "Classic PEAD play following a 'Beat and Raise' Q4 report. The company raised FY2026 guidance significantly above consensus, driven by accelerating demand for its AI-powered 'Verity' finance automation platform, yet the after-hours reaction (+3%) appears muted relative to the fundamental improvement.",
      "catalyst_details": "On Feb 10, 2026, BlackLine reported Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.63 (beating $0.58 est) and raised FY2026 EPS guidance to $2.37-$2.48 (vs $2.35 est), signaling a pivotal turnaround in growth momentum.",
      "absorption_status": "Partially Unpriced. The stock traded up ~3% in after-hours, remaining well below the 8% intraday filter threshold, suggesting the guidance upgrade has not been fully absorbed by the market.",

      "thesis": "Competitor Corcept Therapeutics received an FDA Complete Response Letter (CRL) for Relacorilant on Dec 31, 2025, removing the primary near-term threat to Xeris's Recorlev franchise in Cushing's syndrome. The stock's Jan 2 pullback (-6.8%) erases the initial reaction, offering an attractive entry for a monopoly-extension play.",
      "catalyst_details": "On December 31, 2025, the FDA issued a CRL to Corcept Therapeutics for Relacorilant, citing a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness. This effectively clears the competitive landscape for Xeris's Recorlev for the foreseeable future.",
      "absorption_status": "Inefficient Reaction. Shares rose ~7.6% on Dec 31 but sold off ~6.8% on Jan 2 (likely profit-taking or broad market weakness), leaving the structural improvement in market share dominance largely unpriced.",
